# Santorini

[Santorini](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/194655/santorini), is an abstract board game, first [published in 2004](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/9963/santorini). It is a two to three player turn based game, typically played on a $5 \times 5$ grid, where players must reach the third level of the board.

## üìú Rules
The [rules](http://www.boardspace.net/santorini/english/santorini-rules.html) are fairly simple. Each player sets up the game by placing two workers on the board. Each turn, a worker can be moved to an adjacent square, followed by building on a square adjacent to the square that worker just moved to.

Building increases the height of that square by one. The move destination space must be unoccupied by a worker. The height must be no more than one level higher than your starting height. If a worker builds on a space with height three, that space is capped and can no longer be moved to or built on.

When a player's piece reaches the third level, that player wins. If a player cannot move any of their pieces, that player loses.
